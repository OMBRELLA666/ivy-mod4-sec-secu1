Symmetric & Asymmetric Encryption Demo

This project demonstrates the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption using Python. The script allows the user to enter a short message, then shows how that message can be encrypted and decrypted using both methods.

How the Code Works
1. User Input

The program asks the user to enter any short message.
This message is converted into bytes so it can be encrypted.

2. Symmetric Encryption (Fernet / AES-based)

A single secret key is generated.

The message is encrypted using this key.

The same key is then used to decrypt the ciphertext.

Output shown to the user:

Symmetric key

Encrypted text

Decrypted text

This demonstrates how symmetric encryption uses one shared key for both operations.

3. Asymmetric Encryption (RSA)

The program generates an RSA key pair:

Public key (used for encryption)

Private key (used for decryption)

The message is encrypted using the public key.

It is decrypted using the private key.

Output shown:

Public key

Private key

Encrypted text

Decrypted text

This demonstrates how asymmetric encryption uses two different keys and avoids sharing a secret key.

4. Purpose / Learning Outcome

This project fulfills Outcome 2.1 by showing:

How symmetric and asymmetric encryption work.

The strengths and weaknesses of each approach.

Why real-world systems often combine both methods.
